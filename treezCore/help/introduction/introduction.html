<H2>Introduction</H2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<b>Treez</b> is an <b>open source project</b> located at 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/treez/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/treez/</a>. 
that provides a set of <b>Eclipse plugins</b>. The concept of Treez allows you to create 
custom tree based Graphical User Interfaces (<b>GUI</b>s) for many kinds of scientific applications. 

<h3>Views & Editors</h3>

The heart of Treez is the so called <a class="treezView"></a> which displays
a <b>tree model</b> of the application. The context menus of the tree nodes provide
mouse actions for <b>editing the tree model</b>: if you <b>right-click</b> on a tree node, 
you will see a context menu that is specific to that tree node. The context menu shows a 
list of <b>tree node operations</b> you can choose from, e.g. to add a new child node. 
If you <b>left-click</b> on a node of the tree, the <b>properties</b> of that tree node are 
shown in the so called <a class="treezPropertiesView"></a>. 
  
<p>
The <b>tree model</b> can be exported to a corresponding <b>java code file</b> which has to be opened
in an Eclipse <a class = "textEditor"></a> (e.g. Java Editor). Existing java code in a 
<a class = "textEditor"></a> can be compiled and imported to the <a class="treezView"></a>, too. 

<p>
In addition to the <a class="treezView"></a>, the <a class="treezPropertiesView"></a> and the 
<a class="textEditor"></a>, further views might be expedient to complete a custom application.
The purpose of the so called <a class="treezGraphicsView"></a> (not included in he screen shot below) 
is to show an additional <b>graphical representation</b> for the <b>tree model</b> or for specific
tree nodes. The content of the <a class="treezGraphicsView"></a> might be for example a chart or a block diagrams.

<h3>User interaction</h3>

<p>
In order to <b>edit complex tree models</b>, the Treez concept <b>focuses on context menus for tree nodes</b> 
in the <a class="treezView"></a> and on operations in the <a class="treezPropertiesView"></a> instead
of building up a complex main menu on the top of the application window. As already explained, a distinct 
context menu in the <a class="treezView"></a> will <b>show exactly those actions which are relevant</b> to 
the corresponding tree node. This is not a new idea. Nevertheless, the decision to have small 
main menus/tool bars and to concentrate on the tree nodes actually has a <b>deep impact</b> on the work flows 
and the <b>way you think about your application</b> in Treez.       
</p>

The <b>Treez concept</b> allows you to <b>edit a tree model</b> with 
<ul>   
<li><b>tree node operations</b> in the <a class="treezView"></a> and controls in the 
<a class="treezPropertiesView"></a> or to use</li> 
<li>an <a class="textEditor"></a> of Eclipse to edit java code, utilizing Eclipse features like code highlighting and completion.</li>   
</ul>

The graphical option with mouse clicks in the <a class="treezView"></a> is <b>easy to learn</b> for
<b>new users</b> and the source code option provides an <b>efficient work flow</b> 
for <b>advanced users</b>.
</p>

<h3>Managing complexity</h3>

<p>
The Treez concept could be applied to create GUIs for applications from very different
domains, e.g. for a simulation tool for solar cells or for a vector drawing tool. <b>Tree structures are 
very well suited to manage complexity</b> and therefore it does not surprise that trees are a common 
element in complex applications. Tree structures are not the one and only way to organize the underlying 
elements of an application. In some cases it would for example be better to use a circular structure 
than a tree structure. Lets nevertheless assume that trees can be applied to model the majority of 
applications. The file system on your computer has a tree structure. And you might already use the tree 
in the Package Explorer of Eclipse to manage the source files of huge software projects. 
</p>

<h3>Atoms</h3>

<p>
The idea that an application can be build from underlying elements is useful to organize the application. 
In Treez those <b>underlying elements are called atoms</b> and <a>atoms have several representations</a> or "adaptations":
<ul>  
<li>The <b>TreeNodeAdaption</b> of an atom creates the tree node that is shown in the <a class="treezView"></a>.</li>
<li>The <b>ControlAdaption</b> of the atom creates the atom control that is shown in the <a class="treezPropertyView"></a>.
<li>The <b>CodeAdaption</b> of an atom creates the corresponding piece of code that is shown in the <a class="textEditor"></a>.
<li>The <b>GraphicsAdaption</b> of an atom creates the composite that is shown in the <a class="treezCadView"></a>.
</ul>   
</p>

<p> 
The exemplary <b>atoms</b> that come with Treez are thought to model a common <b>simulation work flow</b>. 
You can use the atoms to control an external executable and perform parameter variations. If you want to apply the 
Treez concept for a completely different application, you are welcome to do so. Please feel free to create 
your custom atoms. An aim of Treez is to make the creation of new atoms as easy as possible. Treez provides
a set of so called <b>attribute atoms</b> that can be used as building block for the creation of new custom atoms.
If users of Treez create new atoms and feed them back to the Treez project, a large atom library will arise with time. 
The extensible <b>plugin structure of Eclipse</b> is perfectly suited for this purpose.
